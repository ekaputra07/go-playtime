# go-playtime

As I'm using Golang more often recently, I found myself to regularly open the official [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org) website to test codes/concepts that I'm not sure about.

**Go Playtime** is just a simple [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) app that loads Go Playground website, and it when it running I just need to click the icon on the tray and BOOM! :)

Here's the demo:

**Note:**

I didn't include the steps on how to build it as an executable app yet, if you're in rush you can just clone/fork this repo and build it your self.

Cheers!
