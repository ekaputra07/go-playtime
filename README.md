# go-playtime

As I'm using Golang more often recently, I found myself regularly open the official [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org) website to test codes/concepts that I'm not sure about.

**Go Playtime** is just a simple [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) app that loads Go Playground website, and when it running I just need to click the icon on the tray and BOOM! :)

Here's the demo:

**Build**

Sorry I didn't provide the executable binary for this app, so you need to build it yourself (tested on Mac only).
```
npm run build
```
It will create a new folder outside of this project diectory which contains the app.

Cheers!
